## [OR, AND and NOT expression](https://facweb.cse.msu.edu/cbowen/cse320/circuit1/video/circuitsM.mp4)
### OR
The first one an *OR* gate. The output is one if either input is one.We notate OR in an expression using the **plus sign**, as in F(A,B) = A + B. The truth table for OR is:

|       A     |       B     |   F(A,B)    |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  0       |     0     |   0    |
|  0       |     1     |   1    |
|  1       |     0     |   1    |
|  1       |     1     |   1    |
